# LiveTrace - Chrome Session Monitoring

Read and follow the instructions in `~/Documents/GitHub/team-claude-commands/livetrace/watchthis.md` to monitor Chrome sessions and capture JobNimbus session data.

Use the scripts from `~/Documents/GitHub/team-claude-commands/livetrace/` directory.

This command captures browser activity only - it does NOT automatically search the codebase or create Linear issues. After the session, use other commands to analyze the data.
