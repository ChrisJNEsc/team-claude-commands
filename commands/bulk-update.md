# Bulk Update All Repositories

Run `git pull origin` on all repositories in `/Users/jobnimbus/Documents/GitHub`.

For each repository:
1. Navigate to the repository directory
2. Run `git pull origin` to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote
3. Display success or failure status
4. Show a summary at the end with total, successful, and failed updates

Run the update operations in the background and provide status updates as repositories are processed.
