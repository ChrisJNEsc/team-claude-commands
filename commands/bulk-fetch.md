# Bulk Fetch All Repositories

Run `git fetch origin` on all repositories in `/Users/chrisberry/Documents/GitHub`.

For each repository:
1. Navigate to the repository directory
2. Run `git fetch origin` to fetch the latest changes from the remote
3. Display success or failure status
4. Show a summary at the end with total, successful, and failed fetches

Run the fetch operations in the background and provide status updates as repositories are processed.
